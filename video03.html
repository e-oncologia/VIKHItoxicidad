									<br>
									<h6>Mechanisms of Immune related adverse effects</h6>
									<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a novel class of drugs used in cancer immunotherapy that have improved overall survival in metastatic melanoma an other advanced stage cancers.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death receptor 1 and 2 (PD-1/PD-2)and PD-1 ligand serve to down regulate T cell proinflammatory responses thus allowing self tolerance and limiting self tissue
										damage. CTLA-4 and PD1 are exposed on the surface of T cells and Pd-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed on the surface of cancer cells are other immune cells. Inhibition of these immunological checkpoints leads to an overall anti tumour
										activity but can also be associated to the loss of self tolerance and excessive inflammatory responses. Immune related adverse effects (IrAE) are thus consequence of this activation of the immune system. The precise
										pathophysiology underlying immune-related adverse events (IrAE) is unknown. CTLA-4 inhibits the immune response in several ways, including attenuating T cell activation at an early step of the immune response, and PD-1 is believed
										to inhibit the immune response at later stages of the immune response in peripheral tissues. There are substantial differences in animal models. Mice lacking CTLA-4 die from lymphoproliferation, whereas mice lacking PD-1 develop
										different autoimmune organ damages. Immune related adverse effects form patients treated with anti CTLA-4 differ from those treated with anti PD1, and globally IrAE associated with anti CTLA-4 are usually more severe.</p>
									<br>
									<p>There are four main possible mechanisms underlying IrAE that are: 1) increased T cell activity against antigens that are present in tumours and healthy tissue. 2) Increased level of preexisting antibodies. 3) Increase of
										inflammatory cytokines and 4) enhanced complement mediated inflammation due to direct binding of an antibody against cytotoxic T lymphocytes.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h6>Incidence and overview of main Immune related adverse effects</h6>
									<br>
									<p>Incidence of IrAE ranges from 60-85% with anti CTLA-4 and 39-70% with anti PD1/anti PD-L1 agents. Combination therapy increases the risk with a RR of 1.5 compared to monotherapy High grade IrAE seems to be higher with ipilimumab
										(43%) compared to nivolimumab or pembrolizumab (20%). Treatment related death is about 2% but there does not seem to be a strong relationship between any single cancer and an associated severe toxicity. Moderate to severe IrAE
										tend to occur earlier with anti CTLA-4 than anti PD-1/PDL1 therapies.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhoea and colitis are some of the most frequent IrAE, and are more frequent with anti CTLA-4 (30-40% of patients treated with Ipilimumab). they usually occur after more that6 weeks of therapy in severe
										cases. Colitis needs aggressive approach from the beginning with oral prednisone in grade 2 toxicity and iv glucocorticoids and infliximab in grade 3-4 toxicity. Hepatitis is much less frequent appearing in 2 to 10% of patients,
										being more frequent with combination therapy (15% G-3). It is important to rule out autoimmune hepatitis as infliximab is contraindicated in this setting.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Dermatologic: Dermatologic symptoms are common and appear in approximately 30-50%. they are more common with Ipilimumab (37-70%) than with anti PD-1 (17-37%). Grade 3-4 toxicities are rare (4%) but can be potentially dangerous.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>Pulmonary: Pneumonitis is rare (2.7%) but it is associated to elevated mortality. It is mainly associated to anti PD1/PDL1. Its incidence is higher in combination therapy, where it can be up to 10. It is very low, < 1%, with anti
											CTLA-4.</p> <br>
											<p>Endocrine: overall endocrine related adverse effects occur in 10% of patients treated. Thyroid dysfunction (mainly hypothyroidism) is more common in patients receiving anti PD1/PDL1 (4-10%) and hypophysitis occurs mainly in
												those receiving anti CTLA-4 (10-17%). Diabetes Mellitus leading to hyperglicemia and ketoacidosis is infrequent.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Rheumatologic: Up to 40% of patients refer arthralgia or myalgia, but the appearance of the novo severe rheumatologic diseases is not that frequent. Arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis are the most common
												musculoskeletal manifestations.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Cardiovascular: less than 0.1% of patients. May be greater with combination therapy. Immune-mediated myocarditis may result in heart failure or arrhythmia, and may be fulminant, progressive, and life-threatening.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Neurologic: incidence 3.8% in patients receiving anti CTLA-4, 6.1% in patients receiving anti–PD-1, and 12.0% in patients receiving combination. Severe events are less than 1% and involve CNS or peripheral nervous system.
												Headache and peripheral sensory neuropathy are the most commonly encountered symptoms.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Haematological: Anaemia occurs in 11% and grade3-4 in 5.8%. Thrombocytopenia in 8%. Other manifestations as TTP, acquired haemophilia are much less frequent</p>
											<br>
											<p>Others: Nephritis: 1-2%; Ocular: 1%Others: Nephritis: 1-2%; Ocular: 1%</p>
											<br>
											<br>
											<h6>Immune related adverse effects in patients with preexisiting autoimmune diseases</h6>
											<br>
											<p>Patients with autoimmune diseases (AID) have been excluded from clinical trials but we have some data from retrospective studies in patients with preexistent AID receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma or non
												small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exacerbation of previous AID occurred in 23-30% of cases and approximately 30% of patients suffered an IrAE, not severe in most cases and needing discontinuation of therapy in a third of
												patients. All studies reported a higher proportion of flares in patients with rheumatologic AID than in other AID (40 to 10% approximately). IrAE were similar than in general population without AID. There was no relationship
												between immunomodulatory treatment for AID and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor or between the development of AID flare and response to immunotherapy. Response to cancer immunotherapy was similar to general population
											</p>
											<br>
											<br>
											<h6>Treatment of Immune related adverse effects</h6>
											<br>
											<p>There are no prospective trials and most recommendations are based on consensus opinion.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Management of Grade 1 toxicities includes symptomatic treatment and in some cases delay checkpoint inhibitor. Grade 2 toxicities demand delaying checkpoint inhibitor administration and include oral glucocorticoids at low
												medium doses for most organ toxicities. In case of pneumonitis high dose prednisone should be administered from this stage. When grade 3-4 toxicities appear immune checkpoint inhibitor administration is usually permanently
												discontinue and management should include high doses of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressant agents, mainly infliximab or other anti TNF, mycophenolate, Methotrexate, anti IL6, anti IL17, IvIG....Immunosuppressant
												agents should be administered early in some severe toxicities.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Additional risks of immunosuppression should be taken into account when evaluating theses patients. Frequently seen secondary effects of glucocorticoids are hyperglycemia, fluid retention, anxiety and osteoporosis. Calcium
												supplementation and vitamin D should be given to all patients receiving glucocorticoids. Opportunistic infections are also a main concern with an increased risk of aspergillus or pneumocystis pneumonia and cytomegalovirus
												hepatitis. Pneumocystis Jirovecii prophylaxis should be added to all patients receiving more than 20 mg of prednisone for more than 4 weeks. A review of 740 patients receiving 898 courses of immune checkpoint blockade for
												melanoma showed that main risk factors for teh development of a serious infection was the use of corticosteroids (OR 7.71) and infliximab (OR 4.74).</p>
											<br>
											<br>
											<h6>Are Immune related adverse effects related to efficacy?</h6>
											<br>
											<p>As the occurrence of IrAE provides evidence of that checkpoint blockade has activated patient’s immune system one important question is whether the magnitude of immune activation increases the chances of success, and the
												general consensus is that these events are not required to obtain a benefit from treatment. On the other hand one could also think that the severity of IrAE could be a measure of the likelihood of a tumour response, but again
												this is not demonstrated except maybe in melanoma where vitiligo could be a sign of response.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Immunosuppression (IS) used to treat IrAE does not seems to modify reduce anti tumour efficacy. Data from retrospective studies have shown that outcomes of patients treated with IS for IrAE are not worse than those who did
												not receive IS for IrAE, but more studies exploring potential relationship between various aspects of immunosuppression (type, duration, timing) are needed.</p>
											<br>
											<br>
											<h6>Conclusions:</h6>
											<br>
											<p>Early recognition and treatment is essential because severe IrAE can have a fatal outcome if not promptly and aggressively treated</p>
											<br>
											<p>Need of patient and care giver education</p>
											<br>
											<p>Need of multidisciplinary teams to address specific symptoms involving emergency physicians</p>
											<br>
											<p>Aetiology and characterization of the different IrAE needs further research and definition</p>

									<h4>Immune-Related adverse events in patients treated with Immune checkpoints inhibitors<span class="negrita">:</span> Management in the emergency room</h4>

									<p>Immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) are a novel class of drugs used in cancer immunotherapy that are becoming more commonly used among advanced-stage cancers. These ICIs, targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
										(CTLA4) and the programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of many different types of cancers and have increased the life expectancy of many patients. However, the inhibition of
										immune checkpoints may lead to unintended tissue damage which manifests into immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) that seem to arise from increase activity in the immune system. </p>
									<br>
									<p>Emergency physicians are encountering increasing number of patients on these medications as well as the associated side effects and it is important that they have the knowledge to recognize these new averages of complications and
										how to treat them. Early recognition and treatment of these irAEs may prevent severe complications, inappropriate discharges from emergency room and ICIs discontinuation. </p>
									<br>
									<p>The irAEs can affect nearly every organ system, normally only one but in some special cases the toxicity may present affecting more than one system. The most common irAEs are dermatological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatical
										and pulmonary; being the cardiological, neurological, ophthalmologic, renal and haematological infrequently reported. Emergency physicians face the challenge of differentiating these irAEs from any other pathology related or not
										with the underlying cancer. Differential diagnosis in the emergency room may embrace from pathology not related with the underlying cancer, complications of the underlying cancer, cancer progression, opportunistic infections (as
										long term ->6 weeks- treatment with immunosupressive drugs increases the chance of opportunistic infections), irAEs affecting one system to irAEs multisystem. The incidence of the irAEs will depend on the ICIs administered and the
										basal substrate of the patient. In general, irAEs occurs quite early, mostly within weeks to 3 months being dermatological and gastrointestinal the earliest to manifest. However, physicians must be aware that risk is still present
										for weeks to months after termination of treatment and that recent history of ICI administration should keep irAE on differential diagnosis. The principle of clinical management of irAEs includes a proacting monitoring, the
										differential diagnosis, the determination of severity, the management and the follow-up. Both proacting monitoring and follow-up are normally exclusively carried out by oncologist in their specific consultation while the
										differential diagnosis, determination of severity and acute management may be carried out in the emergency room by more than one specialist. It is important to distinguish the severity of each irAE and quantify by using the Common
										Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 in order to standardize treatment and follow-up of these patients. In general, low-grade irAEs (grade 1-2) are mild to moderate while grades 3-4 are severe or even life-threatening.
										Grade 1 irAEs should be treated symptomatically and on an outpatient basis and do not need to interrupt ICI treatment while grade 2 or persistent grade 1 should consider oral corticosteroids (0.5-1mg/kg/day) and may need to
										temporary interrupt ICI treatment. Grade 3 and 4 are considered severe forms of presentation, with hospitalization needs and use of high-dose IV corticosteroids (1-2mg/kg/day). In grade 4 toxicities physicians must consider other
										immunosuppressive agents such as infliximab or micofenolate, permanent interrupt of ICIs and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. As grade 1-2 toxicities are usually seen and treated in the oncologist consultation, the emergency
										physicians normally encounter grade 3 and 4 toxicities. Eventhough these toxicities are infrequent, they are much more severe and their management, much more challenging. The most feared irAEs in the emergency room are
										pneumonitis, severe enterocolitis with colonic perforation, autoimmune type I diabetes mellitus presented as diabetic ketoacidosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, miocarditis with reduced ejection fraction, encephalitis and myelitis.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>We should not forget that emergency room is a stressful scenario where physicians must make difficult decisions, such as limit the treatment, decide the ceiling of care or indicate the ICU admission. So that, they must have the
										knowledge and the tools for early detection and management of the irAEs as much as advanced information related with the underlying cancer. They usually find problems with organizational constraints and disagreements between
										different specialists. A multidisciplinary approach should help to better attend these patients, with the emergency physician, the consulting oncologist and the organ-specific physician teams.</p>
									<br>
									<p>In conclusion, we should remember that early recognition and treatment of the irAEs can help to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality and also take into account that emergency physicians are seeing an increasing number
										of these irAEs and should have the knowledge and the tools to early recognize and treat them. We should not forget that risk is still present for weeks to months after termination of treatment and that multidisciplinary approach
										should be taken with these patients.</p>

									<h4>Management of immunotherapy toxicities<span class="negrita">:</span> Point of view of the intensivist</h4>
									<br>
									<p>Gabriel Moreno <span class="negrita">/</span> Intensive Care Medicine Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p>Immunotherapy is a biological therapy that boosts the immune system to fight cancer. There are several molecules that are considered immunotherapy that are classified as passive and active. Active immunotherapy enhances the
										immune system activation through the modulation of endogenous regulatory and/or activatory immune mechanisms, such as the checkpoint inhibitors (CpIs). Passive immunotherapy uses effector cells or molecules of the immune system to
										directly attack tumor cells. Here, we will focus in some active immunotherapy such as the bi-specific antibodies and the CpIs CTLA-4, PD-1 and PDL-1 and some passive therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells therapy
										(CAR-T cells).</p>
									<br>
									<p>The CpIs, by removing inhibition of T-cell function, facilitates T cell activity against host tissues causing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (2). The physiopathology of immune related adverse events is not completely known
										but there are different proposed mechanisms: Increase activity of T cells against healthy tissues, higher levels of preexisting antibodies, an increase of inflammatory cytokines after tumor destruction, and by enhancing the
										complement mediated inflammation to normal tissue in some tissues expressing CTLA-4, between others.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>The common terminology for adverse events (CTAE) of the Cancer Institute classifies the adverse events according to their severity, in five grades: Grade 1 or Mild: Grade 2 or Moderate: Grade 3 or severe (or medically significant
										but not immediately life-threatening); and Grade 4 or life threatening that requires urgent intervention. Grade 5 is death related to AE (4). This classification allows having a common language in the classification of the
										severity of the adverse events but also to determine the management.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>The severity of irAEs are dose dependent in anti-CTLA-4 but not with anti PD1 or PDL1 monotherapies. Monotherapy with CpIs is related with 10 to 20% of grades 3 or 4 side effects. Ipilimumab more frequently induces serious irAEs
										with 27%, whereas in combination, the presence of grade 3/4 irAEs can be as high as 55%. In average, when the CpIs are used in combination, the irAEs are present in one-third of patients. Higher doses of checkpoint inhibitors
										improved survival but the percentage of grade 3 or 4 irAEs in monotherapy with higher doses can reach as much as 50% of cases. Of note, grade 5 irAEs have been reported in 0.38% to 0.6% of the total irAEs. The most frequent organs
										affected in fatal irAEs are colitis, hepatitis and pneumonitis, whereas myocarditis has the highest fatality rate.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>It is important to achieve an adequate diagnosis and implement a prompt therapy with immunosuppressive therapy in order to improve the morbidity and mortality (6). The general management of grade 4 irAEs should include
										symptomatic treatment, support therapy, and the CpIs should be stopped. A work-up assessment of diagnosis and differential diagnosis should be started. Immune-suppression with corticosteroids is the cornerstone treatment but
										alternative drugs should be evaluated if there is not a clinical response to corticoids. Infection has to be ruled out and also because of the use of immunosuppressive drugs the presence of opportunistic infections or some
										prophylaxis has to be considered. Different specialists should be involved with the evaluation of a patient with irAEs because of the complexity and the multi-systemic affection of the irAEs.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>There are also several specific managements according to the organs affected that are going to be discussed in the different topics along the course. Pneumonitis, is one the most frequent reasons for ICU admission and in some
										cases it requires non-invasive or invasive respiratory support. It is important to follow a diagnostic workup, including imaging (chest X rays or high resolution CT scan) and bronchoalveolar lavage to do the diagnosis or to obtain
										samples for opportunistic infections. As we mention before, the main treatment is with corticoids, but another immunosuppressive drugs such as infliximab, mychophenolate mofetil, and intravenous immunoglobulin of cyclophosphamyde
										are alternative therapies if there is no response to corticoids.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>Aside from the previous immunosupressants referred before, different immunosuppressive therapies have been proposed in patients with refractory irAEs. The strategies are as follows: antibodies such as anti-IL-1, -IL-6, -IL-17,
										anti-TNF, anti-integrin-4, anti IL-23, -IL-12 blockage, the use of intravenous immunoglobulins or some janus-kinase inhibitor. Whenever possible, we should obtain a biopsy of the affected organ in order to direct the suggested
										treatment.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>CAR-T cells have demonstrated their success in hematological malignancies, but until now there is no CAR-T cells treatment for solid tumors, however, there are some clinical trials ongoing and several secondary effects that have
										been reported. Also, several trials are evaluating different bi-specific antibodies in solid cancer. Two main complications have been desbribe with those treatments: the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and CART-related
										encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). The CRS is defined as an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that can be produced by external factors mainly secondary to immunotherapy, including bi-specific antibodies and CART cells
										therapy. There is also a grading scale according to the severity of the signs and symptoms. Grade 1 requires symptomatic therapy: grade 2 can be requires supportive therapy with oxygen or low doses of vaso-active drugs if there is
										no response to volume. Grade 3 and 4 should be managed in ICU with organ support. Because in CRS there is an increase in IL-6, tocilizumab should be used in accordance of the specialties involve in the management of the patients.
										Also, if there is no response to IL-6 antagonists, corticoids should be started (12). Also, they can produce CRES but it will be explain in the specific presentation in this course.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>The survival of cancer patients admitted to ICU is increasing along the years. Immunotherapy is a promising treatment that has demonstrated to improve survival in patients with cancer. This creates a new paradigm in the intensive
										care. It is difficult to predict cancer mortality in base on new therapeutic options, combination of treatments and new emerging treatments, so the decision of ICU admission should be performed in a multidisciplinary approach
										involving oncologists, intensivists and other specialists involved in the care of the patients in order to establish the correct goal of care of each cancer patient.</p>
