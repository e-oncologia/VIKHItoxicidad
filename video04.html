									<h4>PULMONARY TOXICITY</h4>
									<br>
									<p class="text-center">Samanta Aso <span class="negrita">/</span> Pneumology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<p>Lung involvement owing to immunotherapy is not a common complication, with an incidence of between 2% and 4%. However, because of the increase in the number of indications of these treatments, an upsurge in the number of cases is anticipated, which is why it is important to recognise this condition.</p>
									<br>

									<p>Pneumonitis is the focal or diffuse inflammation of the lung parenchyma. For its diagnosis, there must be a temporal correlation between the start of treatment, the onset of symptoms and radiological changes. To this end, it is important to ascertain when a patient may begin to manifest symptoms and signs associated with pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pulmonary toxicity is considered a late complication and can occur between three and 19 months after the start of treatment. However, a number of authors have reported immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis two years after the end of this therapy. A further aspect to take into account is the incidence with which the drugs prescribed to the patient may or may not be related to the development of pneumonitis. Pulmonary toxicity by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 is 1.5 to 2 times more common than by anti-CTLA4 in monotherapy; however, when used in combination, the risk of pneumonitis increases threefold. The clinical symptoms that accompany a case of immunotherapyinduced pneumonitis are non-specific (cough, expectoration, dyspnoea, low-grade fever, fever and/or asthenia). Nor is there any pathognomonic radiological pattern. The most common presentation is ground glass opacity (a pattern it shares with other conditions) but it can also occur as organising pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and even in the form of pulmonary nodules. Due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms, and to the fact that it can be confused with other conditions, it is important to emphasise that pneumonitis secondary to treatment is always a diagnosis of exclusion. To this end, the patient’s clinical situation permitting, it is recommended to perform a fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The sample obtained is sent to microbiology to rule out infection, to pathology to rule out disease progression and to cytohaematology to perform a total and differential cell count. A predominance of lymphocytes or eosinophils in the cell count probably indicates the onset of pneumonitis, but a normal cell count does not rule out this diagnosis.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>The following case study illustrates how complex the management of immunotherapyinduced
pneumonitis can be. It concerns a patient with a diagnosis of stage IIIA squamous
cell carcinoma of the lungs requiring concomitant chemotherapy (CT)-radiotherapy (RT)
+ nivolumab within a clinical trial. RT was completed in June 2017 and the fifth cycle
of nivolumab was administered on 13/12/2017. He was admitted to oncology for the
first time in January 2018 with the diagnostic impression of immunotherapy-induced
pneumonitis. However, the fact that the patient had received RT probably played a role in
the patient’s symptoms, and this is due to two reasons: 1) RT leads to the immunogenic
death of cancer cells, which, in turn, can lead to pro-immunogenic effects, increasing the
2
risk of the “autoimmune-like” side effect; and 2) the phenomenon of hypersensitivity owing
to RT or “radiation recall”, defined as the damage caused to the alveolar endothelium
by the RT, which is latent and subsequently manifests through the use of a systemic
treatment. It is also important to ascertain whether the cause of pulmonary toxicity
is immune-mediated or is due to other treatments, since the guidelines that classify
the severity of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis are different from those employed
for CT or RT, in addition to the fact that they provide recommendations as to how the
patient should be managed in the event of hospitalisation or home care. The patient in
question was classified as grade 3 pneumonitis and the recommendations indicated by
the European and American guidelines were followed during his admission, as well as at
home, until all symptoms abated and radiological improvement was seen. This enabled
corticosteroid treatment to be reduced for six months until onset of an intercurrent nonrespiratory
event (presence of optic neuritis). It should be noted that treatment with
nivolumab was not restarted. In June 2018 when, owing to optic neuritis, treatment with
prednisone was reduced from 5 mg/day to 5 mg/48 hours, dyspnoea with respiratory
failure occurred. The X-ray was suggestive of pneumonitis with bilateral involvement
and he was admitted for the second time with a diagnosis of immunotherapy-induced
pulmonary toxicity. As in the first admission, the recommendations indicated by the
guidelines were followed but respiratory deterioration was observed, owing to which
the dose of methylprednisolone was increased (from 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day)
and voriconazole was combined with the antibiotic therapy owing to the presence of
a weak positive galactomannan in the BAL, with no improvement 48 hours after the
treatment adjustment. For this reason, a second immunosuppressant was started
without suspending the corticosteroids, in line with the guideline recommendations, with
infliximab being the first choice. A significant improvement was seen two days postinfliximab,
with resolution of the respiratory symptoms and a progressive radiological
improvement until the disappearance of the pulmonary infiltrates.</p>
<br>
<p>Cases like this highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the
management of immune-mediated toxicity, added to the fact that, nowadays, the
guidelines advise us on what to do. Despite this, there are still many unknowns, such as:
is infliximab the immunosuppressant of choice? And if so, in the event of there being no
response, what is the recommended 2nd option? Or how should corticosteroid treatment
be tapered after a recurrence of pneumonitis in a patient who was already undergoing
corticosteroid therapy?</p>

									<h4>ENDOCRINE TOXICITY</h4>
									<br>
									<p class="text-center">Inma Peiró <span class="negrita">/</span> Nutrition Functional Unit, ICO Hospitalet</p>
									<br>
									<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) including anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) agents have shown antitumor activity by enhancing
										adaptive immune response against cancer cells, resulting in significant long-lasting responses. Although the toxicity profile of the immune checkpoint inhibitors is more favorable than conventional chemotherapy, immune-related
										adverse events (irAEs) can occur as a result of enhancing immune response in normal tissues. IrAEs induced by ICI can potentially affect every organ in the body, but gastrointestinal tract, skin, liver, and endocrine system are
										the most commonly involved sites. </p>
									<br>
									<p>The endocrine system is a common target for irAEs. Patients treated with ICI are at risk of developing hypophysitis, thyroiditis and less common, primary adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune diabetes. It is mandatory monitoring
										hormonal function with an “endocrinological blood assessment” containing TSH; Free T4, baseline serum cortisol, sodium, potassium and baseline glucose, before and during treatment with immunotherapy.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Along the treatment, the patient and the oncology team should be educated on recognizing clinical signs and symptoms suggestive endocrinopathies in order to detect and treat them promptly:</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Fatigue / hypotension / sudden headache / abdominal pain /nausea / vomiting -> suspected diagnosis of: hypophysitis / adrenal insufficiency. Contact with endocrinologist and assess baseline pituitary hormones and
										baseline cortisol.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Tachycardia/ tremor/ weight loss/ sweating -> suspected diagnosis of: hyperthyroidism. Assess TSH, free T4. If abnormal, contact with endocrinologist.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Fatigue/edema / constipation / cold / drowsiness -> suspected diagnosis of: hypothyroidism. Assess TSH, free T4. If abnormal, contact with endocrinologist.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Polyuria / polydipsia / hyperglycemia -> suspected diagnosis of diabetes/hypophysitis. Contact with endocrinologist. Assess baseline pituitary hormones, baseline cortisol and monitoring glucose. </p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h6>Immune induced hypophysitis</h6>
									<br>
									<p>Hypophysitis induced by ICI appears most often in men over the age of 60 years and in patients treated with anti CTLA4 (ipilimumab) alone or in combination with nivolumab. The prevalence varies between 4-20%, increasing in
										combined therapy. The pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely understood. In mice models of hypophysitis treated with anti CTLA-4, lymphocyte infiltration of pituitary gland and the expression of CTL4-antigen on pituitary
										cells have been reported. </p>
									<br>
									<p>Clinical manifestations are often non-specific. The most frequent signs are headache and fatigue. Hyponatremia is present in almost 50% of the patients. Polyuric-polydipsic syndrome (diabetes insipidus) is very rare. Hormonal
										deficiencies are often multiples at the time of diagnosis: central hypothyroidism and central hypogonadism almost in 100% of the patients, hypoprolactinemia in 96%, ACTH insufficiency with adrenal insufficiency in 50% and GH
										insufficiency in 17% of cases. Recovery from hormonal deficiencies is variable and new deficiencies can appear along the follow up. ACTH insufficiency with chronic adrenal insufficiency persists in 86-100% of the cases, and
										patients require chronic therapy with hydrocortisone.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Pituitary RMI is the most sensitive imaging for diagnosis. In 30-100% of cases shows a moderate increase in pituitary volume and enlargement of the pituitary salk suggestive of hypophysitis. These findings are transitory and
										after 4-12 weeks pituitary RMI return to normality.</p>
									<br>
									<p>High-dose corticosteroids are not systematically recommended to treat hypophysitis. (It may be suggested in patients presenting with major headaches, visual aberrations or other severe symptoms).</p>
									<br>
									<p>Treatment of hormonal deficiencies:</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Acute adrenal insufficiency -> In case of signs of acute adrenal insufficiency (dehidratation, hypotension, tachycardia, hyponatremia…) emergency therapy with endovenous hydrocortisone + fluid therapy should be
										started.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Chronic adrenal insufficiency -> (Low cortisol value with minor signs of no signs of adrenal insufficiency), therapy with oral hydrocortisone 15-30mg/day should be started.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Hypothyroidism -> New assessment of thyroid function after 1-2 months, then treatment with levothyroxine should be considered on a case-to-case basis.</p>
									<br>
									<p class="contorno">Hypogonadism -> Assess gonadal function after 2-3months and then consider replacement therapy in the absence of oncological contraindication.</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h6>Thyroid dysfunction induced by immunotherapy</h6>
									<br>
									<p>The thyroid gland is a common site for irAEs. The risk of thyroid dysfunction (TD) is higher in patients treated with antiPD1 alone or in combination with antiCTLA4, with an overall incidence of TD ranging from 4 to 21%. The TD
										includes hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis, which are generally mild to moderate. The cause of TD induced by targeting PD-1, as well as the timing, pattern of the TD and prognosis of patients who develop TD remain unclear. The
										most common TD consists of silent inflammatory thyroiditis with a transient thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. Most of the cases are mild and do not require replacement therapy. Treatment of TD depends on the clinical
										severity and etiological diagnosis and it must be decided on agreement between the endocrinologist and the oncologist. Assessment of thyroid function (TSH; free T4) at baseline and before each cycle during the first 6 months and
										then every 3-6 months is recommended.</p>

									<h4>DERMATOLOGICAL TOXICITY</h4>
									<br>
									<p>Anna Jucglà <span class="negrita">/</span> Dermatology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<p>Despite the fact that immunotherapy has entailed a paradigm shift in the treatment of
cancer, the toxicity associated with these drugs can compromise overall survival as
well as patient quality of life. Hence the importance of detecting and diagnosing these
adverse effects early, in order to offer patients the best therapeutic approach.
Skin toxicity is one of the most commonly observed adverse effects (AEs) in patients
treated with immunotherapy. Although it usually appears early in the course of treatment
(generally in the initial weeks), it may develop months after starting the therapy, or even
after the treatment has ended.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Other less common cutaneous manifestations that have been described include
exacerbation of psoriasis or de novo psoriasis, lichenoid eruptions, bullous diseases,
dry skin, alopecia areata, pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet’s syndrome and cutaneous
sarcoidosis.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>The rash may be either morbilliform or eczematous. It predominantly affects the trunk
and spreads to the limbs; the face is usually spared. It tends to be accompanied by
itching, although it is sometimes asymptomatic.
The rashes and itching that appear in the first weeks of treatment are predominantly
grade 1-2 and can be managed symptomatically with oral antihistamines, topical
corticosteroids and emollients. Class I/II corticosteroids are recommended for the body
and class IV/VI for the face and folds. Treatment does not generally need to be stopped
or interrupted.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>Pruritus usually accompanies a maculopapular rash but may precede it or manifest
with no cutaneous abnormalities (in such cases, skin dryness should be ruled out and
treated). Poorly controlled pruritus can affect the patient’s quality of life. As such, if it
2
does not respond to oral antihistamines then gabapentin, antidepressants or aprepitant
can be used.</p>
									<br>
									<p>For other skin manifestations, particularly if they are grade 3-4, assessment by a
dermatologist is usually necessary. This assessment should be urgent if the patient
presents with bullous lesions on >1% of their body surface area, if they have a painful rash
with or without blisters (excluding herpes zoster) or a rash with mucosal involvement.
A non-urgent dermatological assessment is recommended when there is uncertainty
in the diagnosis of the rash, if it is a grade 2 rash that is getting worse or owing to the
presence of atypical lesions.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Early recognition of immunotherapy-induced skin toxicity and its proper management
can achieve good control of manifestations and avoid the need to interrupt treatment.
As such, collaboration between oncologists and dermatologists is crucial.</p>
