									<h4>NEUROLOGICAL TOXICITY</h4>
									<br>
									<p>Roser Velasco <span class="negrita">/</span> Neurology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<p>Cancer immunotherapy has resulted in a paradigm shift in onco-hemathology. Immunotherapy may be active, inducing an immunotherapy response in vivo. This is the case of vaccine or oncolytic virus that directly sensitizes the
										immune system to tumor-specific antigens. Or it may be passive, by transferring cells or antibodies which have been previously manipulated in vitro, and that will target the tumor or will modulate the natural immune response of
										the patient. Among immunomodulatory strategies, immune check point inhibitors (ICPi) are antagonistic antibodies that block specific immune checkpoint molecules, aiming to enhance general immunoreactivity by augmenting
										co-stimulatory molecules or blocking inhibitory molecules. Unfortunately, by unbalancing the immune system, these immunotherapies may however generate dysimmune toxicities.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Neurological immune related adverse events (irNRLAE) induced by ICPi are thought to result due to the loss of maintenance of self-tolerance and a pathological abnormal immunologic activation, which can affect such as the
										peripheral as the central nervous system (CNS). Different irNRLAE have been described, including encephalitis, myelopathy, aseptic meningitis, meningoradiculitis, Guillain-Barré-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathy (including
										mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and polyneuropathy) as well as myasthenic syndrome, which often vary in severity from mild transient peripheral neuropathies that resolve spontaneously, to persistent conditions that require
										prolonged treatment. Neuromuscular manifestations are the most common, and frequently overlap syndromes with multiple irNRLAEs or other affected organ systems frequently exist. For example, concomitant myasthenia
										gravis-myositis-myocarditis represents a life-threatening continuum of neuromuscular and cardiac toxicity.</p>
									<br>
									<p>This presentation focuses specially on one of the CNS toxicities, immune-related encephalitis (irENC) reported with ICPi, which despite being less frequent (0.1–0.2% of patients treated with ICPi), tend to be challenging and
										serious, sometimes fatal, highlighting the need for its promptly recognition and treatment. Unfortunately, similar to other irNRLAE, only limited information regarding incidence, characteristics, and outcome of associated with
										irENC is available as most information is derived from isolated case reports or rudimentary safety reports collected in the frame of clinical trials. As a result, the relatively short term collective experience available
										information is widely variable regarding diagnosis as well as treatment approaches. A systematic literature search, up to December 2018 was conducted in PubMed database to review the reported clinical picture of irENC. </p>
									<br>
									<p>Clinical presentation includes change in alertness and attention, confusion, altered behavior, headaches, seizures, short-term memory loss, depressed level of consciousness, focal weakness, speech abnormality and hallucinations
										with sudden, transient, or progressive onset, sometimes resembling limbic encephalitis, with variable intensity and frequently associated to fever. Onset of encephalitis can occur early (within a few weeks) or late (7–12 months)
										after ICPi initiation, and even occur after discontinuation of ICPi therapy. Course is usually monophasic despite relapses have been described. Patients under combination of immunotherapy appeared to suffer more severe and
										refractory syndromes and earlier presentation.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Importantly, patients under ICPi therapy can develop a number of neurological symptoms that may or may not be directly related to their therapy, and neurologic consultation is mandatory. The symptoms associated with irNRLAEs can
										range from mild (grade 1-2) to severe (grade 3-4); however, they are often challenging to diagnose like neuromuscular complications that they may present as generalized symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness, that can also be
										caused by the cancer itself. In the case of irENC, differential diagnosis may rule out metastases, metabolic disorders, stroke, infectious encephalitis and neurological adverse effects of previous therapies such as irradiation.
										After CT scan, lumbar puncture should always be performed and typically CSF shows lymphocytic pleocytosis ( < 250/mm3), with elevated protein (usually < 150 mg/dL) and normal glucose. However, normal CSF may not exclude the
											possibility of irENC and it was strictly normal in 5 cases reported in the literature. MRI of brain ± spine with contrast must be done, and may be unremarkable or show T2 hyperintensities. EEG to evaluate for subclinical
											seizures is recommended.</p> <br>
											<p>The optimal management of neurological irAEs including irENC has not yet been established. Treatment is empirically based on the standard of care for the induced disease, mostly based on expert opinions and the knowledge of
												autoimmune diseases, rather than prospective studies. In a patient with suspected irENC, ICPi may be withholding immediately. Consider concurrent antiviral (i.e., acyclovir) and/or bacterial therapy until negative PCR results
												obtained. Prednisolone doses ranging 1 -2 mg/kg or in those severe cases 1 gr x 3 or 5 days, and plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or other or immunosuppressive approaches depending on the evolution have been
												reported to be of benefit. The duration of treatment with immune-suppressive agents has not been tested prospectively but is recommended a full steroid dose treatment course of 2–4 weeks followed by a gradual taper to avoid
												recurrence. Characteristically, neurological symptoms and signs remit within 48-72 hour following initiation of steroid therapy, and in despite in the majority of reported cases, the neurological outcome of the patients has
												been favorable, fatal outcome can be possible.</p>
											<br>
											<p> In summary, the time of irNRLAE, and specifically irENC onset is unpredictable, and evolution may be rapid and life-threatening. Although rare, they will likely be encountered with increasing frequency as ICPi therapy
												expands to other cancers. Early recognition, cessation of immunotherapy, prompt investigation and immunosuppression treatment is crucial for timely improvement of functional outcome and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

									<h4>CARDIOTOXICITY</h4>
									<br>
									<p>Elena García Romero <span class="negrita">/</span> Cardiology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<p>Cardiac complications secondary to immunotherapy are rare because they represent less than 1%. However, they are associated with the highest mortality, around 40%. They have been described with all currently approved agents,
										although we have scarce data and only from case reports or small case series. According to a review of the pharmaceutical safety databases, cardiac complications had an incidence of 0.1%, although this number is probably
										underestimated due to the absence of systematic monitoring in trials of this type of complications. On the other hand, it is foreseeable that the incidence will increase since the use of immunotherapy is spreading to many types of
										tumors and, therefore, more patients will be susceptible to be treated with them in the future.</p>
									<br>
									<p>What has been clearly seen is that the risk increases considerably when combination therapy is used (anti-CTLA-4 antibodies with anti PD1 or anti PDL1 antibodies). For example, in patients undergoing combination therapy with
										Ipilipumab (antiCTLA4) and Nivolumab (anti PD1), the incidence of complications was 0.27% compared to 0.06% in patients who underwent treatment with Nivolumab alone.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>These complications usually appear early, with a median onset of 10 weeks after starting treatment, although they may appear from 2 weeks after its initiation and up to 17 weeks after the end of the treatment. Multiple cardiac
										complications have been described including myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, arterial hypertension, cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction, "Tako-Tsubo" syndrome and even
										acute coronary syndrome. It has been shown that both innate and adaptive immunity promote the development of plaques of atheroma, their progression and destabilization. The presentation can be variable, but we have to think about
										them if the patient reports chest pain, dyspnea, peripheral edema or palpitations. Diagnosis can be difficult, on the one hand because sometimes patients refer nonspecific symptoms and on the other hand because these symptoms may
										be due to disease’s progression, to other complications such as pulmonary thromboembolism or other complications derived from immunotherapy, such as pneumonitis. Mortality is high, with death frequently secondary to refractory
										arrhythmia or cardiogenic shock.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Immune myocarditis is one of the most commonly described cardiac complications in the literature because it can be fulminating, progressive and life-threatening. It may result in heart failure or arrhythmia. It can present itself
										associated with myositis, and also with myasthenia gravis in some cases. It is more common with combination therapy, although up to 66% of cases can occur with single therapy. In addition, we must take into account that up to 51%
										of patients may have a normal LVEF, a difference compared with other causes of myocarditis. The mechanism is explained on the one hand possibly due to cross-reactivity against common antigens and on the other hand because there
										are preclinical data that suggest that both CTLA-4 and PD-1 play critical roles regulating immune homeostasis in the myocardium.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Regarding diagnosis, although there is no evidence of what is the best monitoring strategy to follow, it seems reasonable to try to establish a baseline cardiovascular risk through a detailed clinical history (cardiovascular risk
										factors, previous cardiological history, history of myocarditis, previous use of other cardiotoxic drugs...) and perform an ECG and cardiac biomarkers prior to the start of immunotherapy, especially taking into account the
										potential severity of cardiological complications. In high cardiovascular risk patients or in those with an established cardiac disease, a cardiological assessment would be advisable. Some groups recommend cardiac monitoring
										especially in the first weeks of treatment, with a new ECG and new biomarkers. Once treatment is started, if a cardiac complication is suspected, a new ECG, biomarkers and chest x-ray should be performed to rule out other
										etiologies that may justify the patient's symptoms, both cardiological, like acute coronary syndrome (using cardiac stress testing, heart catheterization or cardiac MRI) or other possible causes (thromboembolism, pneumonitis,
										disease’s progression). It would be advisable to perform continuous cardiac monitoring and refer to a cardiologist to complete the study using echocardiography, cardiac MRI (especially if we suspect myocarditis, since it would be
										the preferred non-invasive technique for diagnosis) and endomyocardial biopsy for patients who are unstable or fail to respond to initial therapy or in whom the diagnosis is in doubt.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>Holding checkpoint inhibitor therapy is recommended for all grades of cardiac complications, including grade 1 (asymptomatic biomarker elevations), and reinitiating therapy is almost never recommended. Treatment for mild-moderate
										complications (grades 2-3) consists of systemic corticosteroids at doses of 1 or even 2 mg / kg per day. In patients with no response after 3-5 days or in patients with severe toxicity (including moderate to severe decompensation,
										highly abnormal testing, fulminant disease, cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure or with life-threatening arrhythmia), higher doses of corticosteroids are needed and an additional immunosuppressive therapy should be added, such
										as tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or thymoglobulin. It is not recommended to add infliximab as it has been associated with heart failure and its use is contraindicated in doses higher than 5 mg / kg in patients with advanced
										heart failure (Class III / IV). In cases in which myocarditis is suspected, some groups recommend systemic corticosteroids at doses of 1 g per day for 3 days followed by 1 mg / kg / day, evaluating adding other immunosuppressants
										agents if there is no adequate response. Contraction and conduction disturbances may improve after holding immunotherapy and with appropriate treatment. The patient’s disease status must be taken into account before excessive
										support measures are performed. There are no recommendations on the resumption of immunotherapy, although it seems reasonable not to restart it, especially in patients who have presented with immune myocarditis.

									<h4>IMMUNOTHERAPY-INDUCED RHEUMATIC AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS</h4>
									<br>
									<p>Francisco Javier Narváez <span class="negrita">/</span> Rheumatology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital</p>
									<br>
									<p>The incidence of immunotherapy-induced rheumatic autoimmune disorders (IRAES:
rheumatic immune-related adverse events) is estimated at 5%-6.6%. They appear to be
more common with anti-CTLA-4 therapy than with anti-PD-1 therapy. The risk is even
higher in combined or sequential CTLA-4/PD-1 therapy compared to monotherapy.
In most cases, they usually appear in the first 12 weeks after the start of treatment (70%
of cases in the first 8 weeks). Around 40-50% of patients with IRAES also present with
other non-rheumatic immune-related adverse events. As with other immune-mediated
complications, it is speculated that the onset of IRAES would be associated with a better
anti-tumour response.</p>
									<br>
									<p>The most common IRAES reported are arthritis, symptoms similar to polymyalgia
rheumatica, Sjögren’s syndrome (dry syndrome) and different types of myopathy. Except
for the management of myopathies, immunotherapy will always be maintained for all
other rheumatic complications whenever possible if it is effective.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Leaving aside arthralgias (the frequency of which in clinical trials ranges from 5% to 16%),
arthritis is the most common rheumatological complication of immunotherapy. In more
than half of cases, clinical symptoms of undifferentiated arthritis in the form of oligo or
polyarthritis, often asymmetric, not deforming or erosive, and transient, usually manifest.
On other occasions, arthritis becomes chronic and adopts the pattern of a well-defined
systemic autoimmune disease, the most common being rheumatoid arthritis (40%) and
spondyloarthropathies, principally psoriatic arthropathy and reactive arthritis with ocular
involvement and urethritis. In these cases, there are some differences with the classic
forms of these diseases. Immunotherapy-induced rheumatoid arthritis occurs equally
in both sexes, is usually seronegative (positivity of rheumatoid factor: 12%; positivity
of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies: 27%), manifests from the onset of the
disease with significant involvement of the flexor and extensor tendons of the hands
and is generally erosive (with early onset of erosions). Cases of spondyloarthropathy
are not associated with HLA-B27, also cause early erosions and, in the case of psoriatic
arthropathy, it is not uncommon for articular symptoms to precede the onset of psoriasis.
The starting treatment for arthritis in patients on immunotherapy is non-steroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids (prednisone or methylprednisolone) at
medium or low doses. In the case of persistence or ineffectiveness, hydroxychloroquine
or methotrexate will be added. In refractory patients, biological rescue treatments have
been trialled (principally TNF alpha antagonists, particularly infliximab, and tocilizumab),
2
without the preliminary evidence available to date demonstrating an increased risk of
infectious adverse effects or loss of efficacy in anti-tumour response in these patients.
Polymyalgia rheumatica-like cases have been reported, particularly in relation to anti-
PD1 therapies. Unlike classical polymyalgia rheumatica, acute-phase reactants are not
always elevated and arthritis plays a major role in rhizomelic clinical symptoms. They
tend to respond well to glucocorticoids, although sometimes medium or high doses are
needed to achieve clinical remission. In cortico-dependent cases (patients who relapse
with low doses of prednisone), methotrexate appears to be effective. Although rare,
some cases have been described of polymyalgia rheumatica associated with giant cell
arteritis confirmed by temporal artery biopsy, so this possibility should be taken into
account in the assessment of these patients.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Sjögren’s syndrome that manifests as a complication of immunotherapy is usually acute
and has a rapidly progressive course. Oral dryness is as or more pronounced than ocular
dryness, which may be absent. Unlike Sjögren’s syndrome, the specific immunology
(anti-Ro antibodies) is negative and the onset of parotid enlargement is very rare. It
usually responds partially or completely to glucocorticoids at medium/low doses and
to sialogogues (pilocarpine).
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>Different types of myositis have been reported as a complication of immunotherapy.
The most common is polymyositis. Some cases of dermatomyositis, myofascitis
(simultaneous inflammation of the muscular fascia and of the proximal and distal
muscles of the lower extremities) and necrotising myopathy have also been documented.
Broadly speaking, the elevation of muscle enzymes in these patients is usually very
marked (CPK x 10-100 IU/l). In addition to the involvement of the proximal musculature,
cases of respiratory compromise have been described, some of them fatal, and with
involvement of the ocular muscles. The concomitant presence of myocarditis in these
patients is also common (32%). For its diagnosis, imaging tests and muscle biopsy,
which usually shows typical findings, are useful. To manage this complication, in addition
to high-dose glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, the temporary suspension
of immunotherapy is usually necessary. These patients respond less to intravenous
immunoglobulins.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Finally, different autoimmune diseases, seemingly induced by immunotherapy, have
been reported, principally sarcoidosis (with pulmonary, cutaneous, muscular and central
nervous system involvement), as well as cases of systemic sclerosis, eosinophilic
fasciitis, lupus nephritis, vasculitis other than giant cell arteritis (granulomatosis with
polyangiitis and single organ vasculitis affecting the central nervous system, retina or
uterus), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like disease, RS3PE syndrome and paraneoplastic acral
vascular syndrome. Similarly, the exacerbation of a pre-existing autoimmune disease
with immunotherapy has been documented, which is particularly common in psoriasis,
although it has also been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia
rheumatica, primary Sjögren’s syndrome and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura.
In most cases, the flare-up of activity is usually of mild to moderate intensity and is
generally transient. This must be taken into account when assessing the risk/benefit of
the indication in patients with an underlying autoimmune disease, but it is not a priori an
absolute contraindication for immunotherapy.
